# Dist samp

A few disclaimers just to be clear
- This project has not been peer reviewed
- I am not a scientist, just a curious programmer
- If you intend to use my scripts for your own studies I highly recommend doing additional research and modifying the code as needed


## Wild cat populations
I chose cats to be the subject of demonstrating my work because they are easily distiquished from one another from camera footage alone. I briefly thought about including a computer vision aspect in this project to automatically do this kind of work, so I could scale to other animals that are more difficult to distinguish, but I do not have the time or patience to work on that, and this was just for fun, so.. If someone out there would like to tackle that and somehow combine our projects that would be exciting, perhaps.
