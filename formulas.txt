the project is kindof 3 parts.

1. Sampling formula, written in Haskell
2. Data simulation and visualization, pygame?
3. Data extraction from video



Camera to pole  83 in 6.9 ft
Camera to plate  144 in 12 ft
Camera to fence  304 in  25.3 ft
Camera 120 degrees 3,036 sq ft



Camera FOV (degrees) * Distance to limit (feet) = Area surveyed (sq ft)
(number of animals seen / percentage of propably seen) / (area surveyed / total area of region) = estimated total in region

-

population_estimate = (seen / probably_seen) / (survey_area / region_area)
where survey_area = cam_fov * limit_dist
and probably_seen = detection function goes here



get the distance from the observer to each observed object
make a list of the distance of each observed object
count the amount of distances (rounded) that are shared
the area of observed data / the area of not observed data becomes the percentage of probably seen


Verify the math..
